      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const players2 = players;

      console.log(players);

      const play3 = players.slice();
      console.log(play3);
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[0] = "mfciskmdcsp";

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: "ada" });
      console.log(person2);
      console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const per = {
        name: "ela",
        age: 25,
        social: {
          twitter: "ela@twit",
          facebook: "ela@fbfb"
        }
      };
      console.log(per);
      const per2copy = Object.assign({}, per);
      console.log(per2copy);
      const per3copy = JSON.stringify(per);
      console.log(per3copy);
      const per4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(per));
      console.log(per4);
      per4.social.facebook = "super";
      console.log(per);
      console.log(per4);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
